**Hi! I'm Dana Amador (he/she), but feel free to call me Dani.**  
I am passionate about exploring and solving complex problems through technology, with interests that span across **database analysis**, **operations research**, and **web development**. I also have a strong foundation in **algorithm analysis**, helping me approach challenges with optimized solutions.

Currently, I'm expanding my skills in **machine learning** and **data analysis**, eager to apply these tools to real-world scenarios. Whether it's creating efficient systems or diving deep into data, I'm always excited to learn and grow as a developer.

Feel free to connect and collaborate with me here on GitHub!
